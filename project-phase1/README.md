Problem:
Bookstore business currently uses an Excel sheet to manage their inventory.

Goal: 
Create a website that allows the user to manage the bookstore inventory. There should be fields to enter title, year, edition and condition, genre.

Of these genres, the books are divided into action, nonfiction, horror, and science. There’s no classification for kids and adult books, and everything should be treated in the same way.

Their tasks are the same, however the permissions should be updated.

What are the set of skills that they currently possess?
Each employee possesses skills to update records, but some shouldn’t be allowed do delete.
